      <h4>Goal</h4>
      <p>The goal of this survey is to identify the awareness and frequency of various <b>parallel performance problems</b>.</p>

      <h4>Scope</h4>
      <p>
        For the purpose of this work, we make assumptions
        about the type of multicore computer where the performance problems occur on. We're looking at the kind of machine that is found
        on the typical desktop: A machine with multiple cores and a shared
        memory with hardware cache coherency, and which runs an operating
        system. We assume a shared-memory programming model based on threads,
        with locks, barriers, semaphores, critical sections and similar
        mechanisms as the main synchronization mechanism. The machine might
        have multiple CPU chips, but all operate on a shared memory with cache
        coherency.

        The cores of the machine may support hardware multithreading; that is
        a single core may be able to execute more than one thread either by
        switching thread every machine cycle (classical multithreading), or by
        intermixing instructions from more than one thread in the execution
        pipeline. <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/trinity-lab/documents/survey.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a>
